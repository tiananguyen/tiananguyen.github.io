            <h1>Nice to Meet You!</h1>
            <p>I'm Tiana Nguyen and I'm currently a senior studying Computer Science with an emphasis in Security at Santa Clara Univeristy.</p>
            <p><mark class="color-emph">I am a developer.</mark> Having been in Silicon Valley my whole life, I’ve had the opportunity to witness the rapid developments in technology and appreciate its ability to link together our systems, our data, and our people. I knew that I wanted to make a contribution to this field, which is why I went into Computer Science. However as I began to explore the field, I've realized that emerging technologies today have quickly outpaced our capacity to consider the ethical implications of these newfound technologies. As a result, I picked up the security emphasis since I believe that it’s important to critically think about what kinds of vulnerabilities and compromises in privacy we’re creating with each added device. I hope to bring the lessons learned and skills gained from university to make contributions in the next step of my career.</p>
            <p><mark class="color-emph">I am a pastry lover.</mark> I may not be a professional at baking, but quaratine has definitely helped my pastry making skills. That irresistible smell of freshly baked pastries around the house is unbeatable. I love that baking allows me to create something tangible that can be enjoyed and shared with others. Someday I hope to work at a bakery or coffee shop and serve delicious, fresh goods for the community to enjoy.</p>
            <p><mark class="color-emph">I am a crafting enthusiast.</mark> Christmas has always been my favorite time of the year because that's when I could make festive crafts like ornament decorations and personalized gifts. At SCU, I would always make use of the Maker Lab to laser cut wood, or 3D print models. Crafting has always allowed me to relax, take my eyes away from the computer, and create something unique.</p>
